Maximum Product Subarray

Given an integer array, the task is to find the maximum product of 
any subarray.

Examples:

Input: arr[] = {-2, 6, -3, -10, 0, 2}
Output: 180
Explanation: The subarray with maximum product is {6, -3, -10} with 
product = 6 * (-3) * (-10) = 180

Input: arr[] = {-1, -3, -10, 0, 60}
Output: 60
Explanation: The subarray with maximum product is {60}.

[Naive Approach] By using two nested loops – O(n^2) Time and O(1) 
Space
[Expected Approach 1] Using minimum and maximum product ending at any 
index - O(n) Time and O(1) Space
[Expected Approach 2] By traversing in both directions - O(n) Time and 
O(1) Space
