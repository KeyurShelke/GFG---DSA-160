Add Two Numbers Represented as Linked List
Given two numbers represented as two lists, the task is to return the sum of two lists.

Note: There can be leading zeros in the input lists, but there should not be any leading zeros in the output list.

Examples:

Input: num1 = 4 -> 5, num2 = 3 -> 4 -> 5
Output: 3 -> 9 -> 0 
Explanation: Sum of 45 and 345 is 390.

Input: num1 = 0 -> 0 -> 6 -> 3, num2 = 0 -> 7
Output: 7 -> 0
Explanation: Sum of 63 and 7 is 70.

Input: num1 = 1 -> 2 -> 3, num2 = 9 -> 9 -> 9
Output: 1 -> 1 -> 2 -> 2
Explanation: Sum of 123 and 999 = 1122.

[Naive Approach] By creating a new list â€“ O(m + n) Time and O(max(m, n)) Space
[Expected Approach] By storing sum on the longer list - O(m + n) Time and O(1) Space
[Other Approach] Using Recursion - O(m + n) Time and O(max(m, n)) Space
