Level Order Traversal (Breadth First Search or BFS) of Binary Tree
Given a Binary Tree, the task is to find its Level Order Traversal. Level Order Traversal technique is a method to traverse a Tree such that all nodes present in the same level are traversed completely before traversing the next level.

Example:

Input:

Output: [[5], [12, 13], [7, 14, 2], [17, 23, 27, 3, 8, 11]]
Explanation: Level 0: Start with the root → [5]
Level 1: Visit its children → [12, 13]
Level 2: Visit children of 3 and 2 → [7, 14, 2]
Level 3: Visit children of 4 and 5 → [17, 23, 27, 3, 8, 11]
