Check if two Strings are Anagrams of each other

Given two strings s1 and s2 consisting of lowercase characters, the task is to check whether the 
two given strings are anagrams of each other or not. An anagram of a string is another string 
that contains the same characters, only the order of characters can be different.

Examples:

Input: s1 = “geeks”  s2 = “kseeg”
Output: true
Explanation: Both the string have same characters with same frequency. So, they are anagrams.

Input: s1 = “allergy”  s2 = “allergic”
Output: false
Explanation: Characters in both the strings are not same. s1 has extra character 'y' and s2 
has extra characters 'i' and 'c', so they are not anagrams.

Input: s1 = "g", s2 = "g"
Output: true
Explanation: Characters in both the strings are same, so they are anagrams.
