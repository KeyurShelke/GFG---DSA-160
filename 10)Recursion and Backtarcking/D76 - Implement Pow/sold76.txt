Write program to calculate pow(b, e)
Given two numbers b and e, the task is to implement a function to compute b^e.

Examples: 

Input: b = 3.00000, e = 5
Output: 243.00000

Input: b = 0.55000, e = 3
Output: 0.16638

Input: b = -0.67000, e = -7
Output: -16.49971

[Naive Approach 1] Using Iteration - O(e) Time and O(1) Space
The idea is to simply multiply b exactly e times using a iterative loop.

Output
243
[Naive Approach 2] Using Recursion - O(e) Time and O(e) Space
The idea is to recursively multiply b exactly e times. To do so, define a recursive function that return b, if e > 0 else returns 1.

Output
243
[Expected Approach] Using Divide and Conquer - O(log e) Time and O(log e) Space
The idea is to use Divide and Conquer and recursively bisect e in two equal parts. There are two possible cases:

If e is even: power(b, e) = power(b, e / 2) * power(b, e / 2);
If e is odd: power(b, e) = b * power(b, e / 2) * power(b, e / 2);

Output
243
Using Inbuilt Functions - O(log e) Time and O(1) Space
The idea is to use inbuilt functions provided by various languages to calculate b^e.

Like in C++, pow(b, e) can be used to calculate b^e. Similarly, in Python, the exact same function can be used, or the **operator can be used to find the power.
