Count Inversions of an Array

Given an integer array arr[] of size n, find the inversion count in the array. Two array elements arr[i] and arr[j] 
form an inversion if arr[i] > arr[j] and i < j.

Note: Inversion Count for an array indicates that how far (or close) the array is from being sorted. If the array is
 already sorted, then the inversion count is 0, but if the array is sorted in reverse order, the inversion count is 
 maximum. 

Examples: 

Input: arr[] = {4, 3, 2, 1}
Output: 6
