Longest Subarray With Equal Number of 0s and 1s
Given an array arr[] containing only 0s and 1s, find the longest subarray which contains equal no of 0s and 1s.

Examples: 

Input: arr[] = [1, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0]
Output: 6
Explanation: arr[1 ... 6] is the longest subarray with three 0s and three 1s.

Input: arr[] = [0, 0, 1, 1, 0]
Output: 4
Explanation: arr[0 ... 3] or arr[1 ... 4] is the longest subarray with two 0s and two 1s.

Input: arr[] = [0]
Output: 0
Explanation: There is no subarray with an equal number of 0s and 1s.
