Minimum Characters to Add at Front for Palindrome

Given a string s, the task is to find the minimum number of characters to be added to the 
front of s to make it palindrome. A palindrome string is a sequence of characters that reads 
the same forward and backward.

Examples: 

Input: s = "abc"
Output: 2
Explanation: We can make above string palindrome as "cbabc", by adding 'b' and 'c' at front.

Input: str = "aacecaaaa"
Output: 2
Explanation: We can make above string palindrome as "aaaacecaaaa" by adding two a's at front 
of string.
