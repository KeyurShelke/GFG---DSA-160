Pair with given sum in a sorted array
2 Sum - Count Pairs with given Sum in Sorted Array
Given a sorted array arr[] and an integer target, the task is to find the number of pairs in the array whose sum is equal to target.

Examples: 

Input: arr[] = [-1, 1, 5, 5, 7], target = 6
Output: 3
Explanation: Pairs with sum 6 are (1, 5), (1, 5) and (-1, 7).         

Input: arr[] = [1, 1, 1, 1], target = 2
Output: 6
Explanation: Pairs with sum 2 are (1, 1), (1, 1), (1, 1), (1, 1), (1, 1) and (1, 1).

Input: arr[] = [-1, 10, 10, 12, 15], target = 125
Output:  0

In this post, we are counting pairs with given sum when the input array is sorted. To count the pairs when the input array is not sorted, refer to 2 Sum â€“ Count pairs with given sum.
