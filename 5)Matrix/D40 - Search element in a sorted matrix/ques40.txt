Search element in a sorted matrix

Given a sorted matrix mat[][] of size nxm and an element x, the task is to find if x is present in the matrix or not. Matrix is sorted in a way such that all elements in a row are sorted in increasing order and for row i, where 1 <= i <= n-1, the first element of row i is greater than or equal to the last element of row i-1.

Examples:

Input: x = 14, mat[][] = [[1, 5, 9],
[14, 20, 21],
[30, 34, 43]]
Output: true

Input: x = 42, mat[][] = [[1, 5, 9, 11],
[14, 20, 21, 26],
[30, 34, 43, 50]]
Output: false
